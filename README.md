# Airbnb Clone Project

## üß≠ Project Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-stack web application that replicates core features of the Airbnb platform. It is designed for learners to gain practical experience with backend development, API design, database modeling, CI/CD workflows, and secure application deployment.

### üéØ Project Goals
- Understand backend system design and architecture.
- Implement secure and scalable RESTful and GraphQL APIs.
- Learn collaborative software development using GitHub.
- Build a functional database schema using MySQL.
- Set up and manage CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Apply modern DevOps tools (Docker, GitHub Actions).

#### 2. **Property**
- `property_id` (Primary Key)
- `owner_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí User)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

#### 3. **Booking**
- `booking_id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí User)

## üöÄ Feature Breakdown

- **User Registration & Login** (with authentication)
- **Property Listing Management** (create, update, delete listings)
- **Search & Filtering** for available properties
- **Booking System** (select dates, calculate price)
- **Review System** (submit and view feedback)
- **Payment Integration** (mock or real gateway support)
- **Admin Dashboard** (for managing users and listings)

## üîê API Security

- **Authentication**: Uses token-based auth (JWT) for secure access.
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions to restrict access to sensitive actions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting API calls per user/IP.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Protects against SQL injection and XSS.
- **HTTPS/TLS**: Ensures encrypted data transmission.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**. It is a set of practices that enable teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.

### Benefits
- Speeds up the release cycle.
- Automatically runs tests on every push or pull request.
- Reduces manual errors in the deployment process.
- Ensures consistent deployment environments.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, building, and deploying the app.
- **Docker**: Creates a consistent development and production environment.
- **Shell Scripts**: Used to automate database migrations and service restarts.
